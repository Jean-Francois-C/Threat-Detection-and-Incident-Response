### III. MITRE ATTACK & DEFEND FRAMEWORKS

#### 1. MITRE ATTACK Framework

+ MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. 
  It documents common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that advanced persistent threats use against Windows enterprise networks.
  
+ The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector,
  in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

+ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) 
  + TACTICS represent the “why” of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. 
    It is the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access.
  
  + TECHNIQUES represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. 
    For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access.
  
  + PROCEDURES are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or sub-techniques. 
    For example, a procedure could be an adversary using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials by scraping LSASS memory on a victim.
    Procedures are categorized in ATT&CK as the observed in the wild use of techniques in the "Procedure Examples" section of technique pages.

+ There are currently 14 Enterprise tactics (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/)

#### 2. MITRE DEFEND Framework

+ The MITRE D3FEND framework is an initiative developed to enhance cybersecurity defense mechanisms by creating a structured and comprehensive knowledge base of defensive cybersecurity techniques. It is designed to help cybersecurity professionals understand and counter adversary tactics and techniques by offering a catalog of defensive measures, specifically focused on mitigating potential cyber threats. 

+ The D3FEND matrix encodes a knowledge base of cybersecurity countermeasures using a semantic model and linked data. It aims to support queries, analysis, and automation of cyber defense solutions and threats.

+ It’s mission is to reduce the attack surface and improve an organization's security posture by offering real-world countermeasures based on adversary tactics and techniques.

+ There are currently 7 tactics in the D3FEND matrix (https://d3fend.mitre.org)
  
|   Tactic   |   Tactic description  | Defensive technique  | 
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| 1. Model  |  The model tactic is used to apply security engineering, vulnerability, threat, and risk analyses to digital systems | Asset Inventory, Network Mapping, Operational Activity Mapping, System Mapping  |
| 2. Harden  |  The harden tactic is used to increase the opportunity cost of computer network exploitation | Agent Authentication, Application Hardening, Credentials Hardening, Message Hardening, Platform Hardening, Source Code Hardening  |

### IV. The Cyber Attack Kill Chain Model & Defense

+ Definition and Goals
  + The “Kill Chain” is a traditional warfare term most often used by the US Air Force in defining the command and control process for targeting 
and destroying enemy forces in order to make it most difficult for the enemy to continue in battle. 
  + Of late, Kill Chain has been applied by both the US Military and leading cyber threat defense teams at Mitre and Lockheed Martin to define 
a new defensive strategy for guarding against advanced persistent threats (APT) and other targeted cyber attacks.
  + In cyber attack, the “Kill Chain Defense” exploits the fact that a successful attack must complete all stages from planning and malware introduction 
to expansion and one or more command and control phases, until the target is identified, manipulated and ex-filtrated.  

+ Objective
  + The goal of a kill chain defense is to break one or more stages in the attack chain to stop the progress of the attack and force the opponent to start over. 
  + It is important to remember three things in this method:
    - the bad guy must make the entire chain work to succeed; 
    - you need only kill one link to stop them;
    - having detection and kill capability at each point in the enemy’s attack chain gives you the highest probability of success in this defense.	
  + The goal is to use the “kill chain” to help you develop capabilities that allow you to identify attacks earlier in the kill chain, rather than waiting for late-stage attacks to become apparent. In other words, develop capabilities that help you identify intrusions while they are still in phases 1, 2, or 3 – and the lower the number, the better.

+ The 7 "Kill Chain" phases
  + The intrusion kill chain breaks intrusions down into distinct phases, which are defined quite well in the Lockheed Martin paper:
```
➤ Phase 1 - Reconnaissance
  ------------------------
  + The reconnaissance phase of a cyberattack is focused on learning as much as possible about the target.  
    This can include the use of open-source intelligence (websites, social media, etc.) and active investigation of the target environment.  
  + Research, identification and selection of targets, often represented as crawling Internet websites such as conference proceedings and mailing lists
    for email addresses, social relationships, or information on specific technologies. 
    
➤ Phase 2 - Weaponization
  -----------------------
  + The goal of the reconnaissance phase is to discover a potential attack vector, and weaponization is intended to develop a method of exploiting a 
    discovered weakness. This may include development of custom malware, crafting a phishing email, etc.
  + Coupling a remote access trojan with an exploit into a deliverable payload, typically by means of an automated tool (weaponizer). 
    Increasingly, client application data files such as Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) or Microsoft Office documents serve as the weaponized deliverable. 

➤ Phase 3 - Delivery
  ------------------
  + Transmission of the weapon to the targeted environment. 
    The three most prevalent delivery vectors for weaponized payloads by APT actors, as observed by the Lockheed Martin Computer Incident Response Team (LM-CIRT)
    for the years 2004-2010, are email attachments (phishing), websites, and USB removable media. 
  + The delivery stage involves setting up the target for exploitation. This could be as simple as clicking send on a phishing email or may involve 
    a complicated process of getting the right person at the right place at the right time.  
    
➤ Phase 4 - Exploitation
  ----------------------
  + The exploitation phase is when the attacker takes advantage of the discovered weakness to gain access to the target environment.  
    This may involve exploiting a vulnerability in a webserver, a user enabling macros on a malicious document, etc.
  + After the weapon is delivered to victim host, exploitation triggers intruders’ code. Most often, exploitation targets an application or operating system
    vulnerability, but it could also more simply exploit the users themselves or leverage an operating system feature that auto-executes code.

➤ Phase 5 - Installation
  ----------------------
  + Installation of a remote access trojan or backdoor on the victim system allows the adversary to maintain persistence inside the environment.
  + One of the goals of a cyberattack is to gain a foothold on the target network. Once the identified vulnerability has been exploited, 
    an attacker should be able to install and execute malware on the target system.
  
➤ Phase 6 - Command and Control (C2)
  ----------------------------------
  + Typically, compromised hosts must beacon outbound to an Internet controller server to establish a C2 channel. 
    APT malware especially requires manual interaction rather than conduct activity automatically. 
    Once the C2 channel establishes, intruders have “hands on the keyboard” access inside the target environment.
  + A great deal of malware is designed to be interactive, receiving instructions from its creator and/or sending data to them.  
    Establishing a channel for these communications is the next stage in the process.  
  
➤ Phase 7 - Actions on Objectives
  -------------------------------
  + Only now, after progressing through the first six phases, can intruders take actions to achieve their original objectives. 
    Typically, this objective is data exfiltration which involves collecting, encrypting and extracting information from the victim environment; 
    violations of data integrity or availability are potential objectives as well. 
    Alternatively, the intruders may only desire access to the initial victim box for use as a hop point to compromise additional systems
    and move laterally inside the network.
```

###  V. Threat Detection & Incident Response (TDIR)

> Nowadays companies are more exposed than ever to a vast array of cyber threats. From ransomware to crypto-mining malware, phishing emails to DDoS attacks, organizations constantly grapple with the challenge of identifying and responding to threats in real time. Failure to do so can result in data breaches, financial losses, damaged reputation, and regulatory fines.

#### PROCESS / METHODOLOGY

#### STEP 1. Preparation 

+ Define and implement a comprehensive incident response plan
  - An incident response plan is a set of instructions that help organizations respond to a security incident swiftly and effectively. This plan should outline the roles and responsibilities of all team members, detail the procedures for ingestion and troubleshooting, then responding to different types of incidents. It should provide guidelines for communicating with stakeholders during and after an incident, including lessons learned and process improvement along with potential tooling enhancement.
  - Having a comprehensive incident response plan in place can significantly reduce the time it takes to respond to a security incident, minimizing the damage and disruption it can cause. It can also help to ensure that all team members know what to do in the event of an attack, boosting the organization’s overall security posture.
  - A clearly communicated incident response plan is critical to an organization’s cyber resilience. By defining discrete steps across all response activities, the plan enables security teams to reduce business disruption and mitigate operational impact arising from security incidents.

+ Determine a clear escalation path
  - Establishing a clear escalation path is crucial for efficient threat response. When a potential threat is detected, the relevant information should be quickly escalated to the right personnel or team for further analysis and remediation.
  - The escalation path may vary depending on the severity of the threat, its potential impact, and the skills required to handle it. Some types of threat, if they are high-level in terms of potential impact for media or external awareness, should have an executive sponsor or contact for informing at speed.
  - A clear and well-documented escalation and communication path can speed up the response process and ensure threats are handled by the appropriate expertise.

+ Centralize the Incident Response Process
  + By using SIEM and SOAR solutions, we can more effectively correlate and analyze information from across our environment. When we are responding to an attack, logging into multiple tools slows down our investigation, giving attackers more opportunities to hide in our systems and networks. With all our monitoring and investigation in a centralized location, we can build workflows and processes that streamline activities, enabling us to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident faster.

+ Identify attack scenarios, define relevant detection use cases and create high-fidelity risk-based alerts
  + Security operations centers (SOCs) commonly receive many more alerts than they can process, which results in time being wasted investigating false positives while true threats are overlooked. Threat detection tools must generate high-quality alerts with low false-positive rates to ensure that security teams are able to focus on real threats to the enterprise

+ Define Reporting Requirements
  + We should have well-defined processes for reporting to management after you recover impacted systems. As part of reviewing our incident response plan’s effectiveness, we should have metrics for how quickly and effectively we:
    + Detected the incident
    + Investigated the incident
    + Contained and eradicated the attacker
    + Recovered systems

+ Conduct regular TDIR testing and training
  - Regularly test your detection and response capabilities through purple and red teaming exercises.
  - Conduct training sessions for staff on the latest threats and response procedures to ensure everyone is prepared.
        
#### STEP 2. Proactive Threat Hunting (and Attack Surface Monitoring)
+ The second step involves monitoring the attack surface of an organization and actively looking for potential threats that could jeopardize an organization’s digital assets. Unlike traditional security measures that react to threats, proactive threat hunting seeks to identify threats before they cause damages.
+ Threat hunting requires acquiring and maintaining a deep understanding of the organization’s infrastructure, systems, and typical network behaviors. By knowing what’s normal, security teams can quickly spot any anomalies that could indicate a potential threat. It also involves staying updated on the latest threat intelligence externally, especially specific to your industry and geography, to anticipate new types of attacks.

+ Four threat-hunting methodologies exist
```
1. Structured hunting
   ➤ Combining attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with Indicators of Attack (IoA) often aligned to a known framework, like MITRE ATT&CK
2. Unstructured hunting
   ➤ Using a trigger event, like an Indicator of Compromise (IoC), to search logs for pre-detection and post-detection patterns
3. Intel-based hunting
   ➤ Initiating reactive hunting with inputs from IoCs, like hash values, domain names and networks, host artifacts, and IP addresses
4. Hybrid hunting
   ➤ Designing customized searches based on situational awareness that use structured, unstructured, and intel-based methodologies
```

+ Benefits of proactively detecting threats
```
1. Reduce Risks          - Identify vulnerabilities and threats early, reducing the chances of a successful breach.
2. Minimize Downtime     - Faster response times can lead to quicker recovery and reduced business disruption.
3. Protect Assets        - Safeguard critical data and intellectual property from theft or damage.
4. Stay Ahead of Threats - Continuously update threat intelligence to anticipate and prepare for emerging threats.
5. Save Costs            - Preventing or swiftly addressing incidents can reduce the financial impact of data breaches.
```

#### STEP 3. Incident Detection
+ The third step is the detection and identification of threats and anomalies at scale thanks to advanced security tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR, XDR, IPS, AV) that use both signature-based and behaviour-based detection methods and that perform log analysis and event correlation.
+ The main objectives are to:
  + detect threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures at the earliest stages of execution
  + trace the malicious activities to identify compromised assets and identify the malicious actor

#### STEP 4. Incident Investigation (Threat Analysis and Prioritization)
+ The fourth step is to prioritize and analyze the threats and anomalies that have been detected. Not all threats pose the same level of risk in terms of affect or impact to the organization, so it’s important to determine which ones need immediate attention. This step is crucial for devising an effective response strategy.
+ Analysis involves understanding the nature of the threat, its origin, its current reach and scope, and its potential trajectory.
+ Prioritization involves assessing the potential impact of the threat on the organization’s operations and data.
  
#### STEP 5. Containment
+ The objective of the fifth step is to contain and mitigate the damages that have already been caused.
+ The response could involve various actions such as:
  + lock compromised or malicious user/service/machine accounts
  + shut-down or isolate affected systems
  + block malicious external/internal IP addresses, domains and URLs
  + block malicious senders/domains on emails
  + quarantine files
  + disable system services
  + force an MFA check
  + rotate passwords
  + patch a vulnerability
  + ...
+ The cyber incident response plan should outline the containment procedure (playbook) that the CSIRT team must follow for each type of incidents / cyber attacks. 

#### STEP 6. Eradication
+ The objective of the sixth step is to eradicate the threat.
+ This step could involve various actions such as:
  + remove malicious user/service/machine accounts
  + remove malicious files, services, registry keys, ...
  + remove rogue network device
  + revoke authentication credentials (e.g. certificates, tokens, keys)
  + ...
+ The cyber incident response plan should outline the eradication procedure (playbook) that the CSIRT team must follow for each type of incidents / cyber attacks. 

#### STEP 7. Recovery and remediation
+ Recovery involves restoring business operations to normal, repairing any damage and addressing any residual effects of the threat.
+ This step could involve various actions such as:
  + restore data from backup tapes
  + recover lost data using forensic tools (if no backup)
  + reinstall software and systems from (safe) backup images
  + unlock legitimate user/service/machine accounts
  + application & systems hardening
  + patch vulnerabilitie
  + upgrade software and OS versions
  + ...
    
#### STEP 8. Lessons Learned
+ Learning involves conducting a post-incident analysis to understand what went wrong and how to prevent similar incidents in the future through process, technology and tools, and improved procedures.

#### Some best practices for effective TDIR

+ Define and assign clear Roles and Responsibilities
  + Cyber attacks disrupt IT services, but they’re more than just technical issues. Attacks impact everyone across the organization, so you should define the following roles and responsibilities:
    + IT Team: assessing severity, investigating incident, containing attack, recovering impacted systems, tracking and documenting activities
    + Human Resources: communicating with employees whose data has been impacted
    + Marketing or Communications: communicating across social media and responding to media requests
    + Senior Leadership: monitoring ongoing business impact and reviewing post-incident reports
    + Customer Support: handling incoming support tickets and updating customers during the incident

+ Proactive threat hunting
  - Actively look for potential threats that could jeopardize your organization’s digital assets. Unlike traditional security measures that react to threats, proactive threat hunting seeks to identify threats before they cause damage.

+ Implement continuous monitoring
  - Implement tools and solutions that provide real-time monitoring of networks, systems, and applications.
  - Continuous monitoring is crucial for effective threat detection and response. Organizations should monitor their systems and networks 24/7, using tools like SIEM and EDR to detect suspicious activities as soon as they occur.

+ Automate threat response
  - Automating threat response can help organizations quickly and effectively neutralize threats. This can involve using automated scripts to block malicious IP addresses, isolate affected systems, or execute other predefined response actions. Automation can also extend to the remediation process, such as automatically patching known vulnerabilities.
  - Advanced tools such as next-generation SIEM, and XDR systems can integrate with other security systems like security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) to automatically react to threats and anomalies they identify. 

+ Educate employees on cybersecurity to reduce human error and promote security awareness.
  
+ Threat Intelligence Integration
  - Leverage threat intelligence feeds to stay updated on the latest threat vectors and indicators of compromise.

+ Forensic Capabilities
  - Maintain capabilities to conduct digital forensics, helping to understand the scope and impact of an incident and to prevent future occurrences.

+ Conduct regular security assessemnts
  - Regular vulnerability assessments can help organizations identify security weaknesses (e.g., missing critical patches, default credentials) before a threat actor can exploit them. These assessments should be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the organization’s systems, applications, and networks.
  - Regular network and application penetration testing can help to uncover vulnerabilities that might not be visible during a vulnerability assessment. Penetration tests simulate real-world attacks, testing the organization’s defenses and providing insights into how well they can withstand an actual attack.

+ Network Segmentation
  - Use network segmentation to limit the spread of threats and contain incidents.

#### Common SOC Challenges
  + Shortage of cybersecurity skills
    + Many SOC teams are understaffed and lack the advanced skills necessary to identify and respond to threats in a timely and effective manner. The (ISC)² Workforce Study estimated that the cybersecurity workforce needs to grow by 145% to close skills gap and better defend organizations worldwide.
  + Too many alerts
    + As organizations add new tools for threat detection, the volume of security alerts grows continually. With security teams today already inundated with work, the overwhelming number of threat alerts can cause threat fatigue. In addition, many of these alerts do not provide sufficient intelligence, context to investigate, or are false positives. False positives not only drain time and resources, but can also distract teams from real incidents.
  + Operational Overhead
    + Many organizations use an assortment of disconnected security tools. This means that security personnel must translate security alerts and policies between environments, leading to costly, complex, and inefficient security operations.

#### Cyber Fusion Center (CFC)
+ A Cyber Fusion Center (CFC) is an advanced cybersecurity operations center or next-generation SOC that integrates and aligns people, processes, and technologies to enhance the organization's ability to detect, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats and incidents. It is an evolution of the traditional Security Operations Center (SOC) and typically incorporates elements of threat intelligence, incident response, and proactive threat hunting in a collaborative and integrated environment.
+ The overarching goal of a Cyber Fusion Center is to foster a holistic, collaborative, and intelligence-driven approach to cybersecurity operations, enabling organizations to proactively identify, respond to, and mitigate cyber threats in an agile and integrated manner.

+ Key characteristics of a Cyber Fusion Center may include:

### VII. ISO/IEC 27035 — Information Security Incident Management

> The standard covers the processes for managing information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities.
Managing incidents effectively involves detective and corrective controls designed to recognize and respond to events and incidents, minimize adverse impacts,
gather forensic evidence (where applicable) and in due course ‘learn the lessons’ in terms of prompting improvements to the ISMS,
typically by improving the preventive controls or other risk treatments.

#### The standard lays out a process with 5 key stages:
+ Step 1 - Plan and prepare for handling incidents (e.g. prepare an incident management policy, form an Incident Response Team and establish a competent team to deal with incidents)
	   
+ Step 2 - Identify and detect potential security incidents through monitoring and report all incidents

+ Step 3 - Assess incidents and make decisions about how they are to be addressed (e.g. patch things up and get back to business quickly, or collect forensic evidences even if it delays resolving the issues)

+ Step 4 - Respond to the incident: contain, eradicate, recover from and forensically analyze the incident, where appropriate;

+ Step 5 - Learn and document key takeaways from every incident (more than simply identifying the things that might have been done better, this stage involves actually making changes that improve the processes)

--------
### VIII. Glossary of TDIR and DFIR terms and definitions

+ DFIR - Digital Forensics & Incident Response
  + Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) teams are groups of people in an organization responsible for managing the response to a security incident, including gathering evidence of the incident, remediating its effects, and implementing controls to prevent the incident from recurring in the future.
  
+ TDIR - Threat Detection & Incident Response
  + Threat Detection & Incident Response (TDIR) refers to the processes, tools, and strategies used to identify, monitor, and analyze cybersecurity threats in real-time, and to respond to security incidents when they occur. While Threat Detection focuses on identifying malicious activities, abnormal behaviour or vulnerabilities within a system or a network, Incident Response is concerned with managing and mitigating the impact of a security breach or attack once detected.
 
+ Cyber Threats
  + The world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving, with new threats emerging every day. Understanding the different types of threats that exist is crucial for security teams to effectively protect their organizations.
  + Cyber threats can be separated into 2 main categories:
    + Common cyber threats including: data leakage, ransomware, crypto mining malware, distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, etc.
    + Advanced persistent threats (APT) which are sophisticated cyber attacks that include long-term surveillance and intelligence gathering, punctuated by attempts to steal sensitive information and target vulnerable systems. They intentionally attack specific high-value targets.

+ TA - Threat Actors
  + A threat actor, also known as a malicious actor, is any person or organization that intentionally causes harm in the digital sphere. They exploit weaknesses in computers, networks and systems to carry out disruptive attacks on individuals or organizations.
  + Motivations for Threat Actors range from hacktivism to cyber espionage and financial gain:
    + Cybercriminals usually seeks monetary gain by retrieving/stealing data that they can sell to a 3rd party or by directly exploiting a victim through a ransomware attack or installation of crypto mining malware.
    + Insider threats may be selling information to competitors or comitting frauds. If they have a grudge against their company, they could attempt to compromise the network in retaliation. 
    + Nation-state threat actors are politically or nationalistically motivated. They primarily seek to improve their nation’s counter-intelligence but may have more disruptive goals as well, such as espionage, spreading disinformation and propaganda, and even interfering with key companies, leaders or infrastructure. 
    + Terrorists and hacktivists are also politically motivated but do not act at the state level. Hacktivists want to spread their individual ideas and beliefs while terrorists aim to spread mayhem and fear to accomplish their goals.

+ TI - Threat Intelligencee
  + Threat intelligence is data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actor’s motives, targets, and attack behaviors. Threat intelligence enables to make faster, more informed, data-backed security decisions and change behavior from reactive to proactive in the fight against threat actors.
  + Gathering actionable intelligence can be done from various sources including open-source intelligence (OSINT), network traffic analysis, and other security tools. Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge (e.g., context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and action-oriented advice) about existing or emerging menaces or hazards to assets.

+ CERT / CSIRT - Computer Emergency Response Team / Cyber Security Incident Response Team
  + A computer emergency response team (CERT) is an expert group that handles computer security incidents. Alternative names for such groups include cyber emergency response team, computer emergency readiness team, and Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT).
  + Although CSIRT and CERT are often used intertwined, there is a distinct difference between the two. The term CERT is typically reserved for the predominant computer security organisations authorised by government authorities, while a CSIRT can be the general incident response team in any organisation.

+ FIRST - Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams
  + FIRST is a global forum of incident response and security teams. They aim to improve cooperation between security teams on handling major cybersecurity incidents. FIRST is an association of incident response teams with global coverage.

+ SOC - Security Operation Center
  + A security operations center is a central function in an organization where security experts monitor, detect, analyze, respond to, and report security incidents. A SOC is typically staffed 24/7 by security analysts and IT engineers who use a variety of tools and techniques to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats. This helps ensure threats are contained and neutralized quickly, which in turn allows organizations to reduce their “breakout time” — the critical window between when an intruder compromises the first machine and when they can move laterally to other parts of the network.
  + The SOC team implements the organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy and acts as the central point of collaboration in coordinated efforts to monitor, assess, and defend against cyberattacks.

+ CFC - Cyber Fusion Center
  + A Cyber Fusion Center (CFC) can be thought of as an advanced or next-generation SOC.
  + The CFC employs a proactive approach to identifying threats and defending against them in a unified and timely manner. It fosters collaboration among various teams within an organization to support cybersecurity. This improves threat intelligence gathering, shortens the time it takes to respond to and stop an attack and reduces overall damage to the organization. These teams can include Security Operations, CSIRT, Threat Intelligence team, IT Operations, Fraud/Legal, and so on.

+ SOC Use Cases
  + SOC use cases are security incident detection rules applied to logs that trigger alerts. For each use case there should be a playbook or instructions on how to respond to them (i.e. steps to analyse and mitigate).
  + SOC use case development is a formalized mechanism for the selection and implementation of scenarios of cybersecurity incident detection rules, tools, and response measures. The end goal: build a repetitive process for detecting incidents and put down standardized response plans to various types of threats.

+ SOAR - Security Orchestration, Automation & Response solution
  + Software solution that enables security teams to integrate and coordinate separate tools into streamlined threat response workflows. SOAR's orchestration and automation capabilities allow it to serve as a central console for security incident response. Security analysts can use SOARs to investigate and resolve incidents without moving between multiple tools.
  + By integrating security tools and automating tasks, SOAR platforms can streamline common security workflows like case management, vulnerability management, and incident response. SOAR security solutions can automate low-level, time-consuming, repetitive tasks like opening and closing support tickets, event enrichment, and alert prioritization.
  
+ SIEM - Security Information & Event Management
  + A SIEM product collects information (raw logs and security alerts) from applications, systems and internal security tools (e.g. IPS/IDS, EDR, AV, WAF, Firewall, Proxy) aggregate it in a central log, and detect anomalies. They provide real-time analysis of logs and security alerts making them a vital component in the threat detection process.

+ EDR - Endpoint Detection and Response
  + EDR tools provide real-time monitoring and collection of endpoint data, allowing security teams to detect, investigate, and prevent potential threats. They are capable of identifying, analyzing and blocking suspicious activities on endpoints such as laptops, workstations, servers and mobile devices. They also provide threat hunting and response capabilities.

+ XDR - Extended Detection and Response
  + XDR integrate multiple security products into a cohesive security incident detection and response platform.

+ IDS/IPS - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
  + Intrusion detection and prevention systems are critical components of a robust threat detection and response strategy. They monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and policy violations. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) analyze network traffic to detect potential threats and alert security teams, while intrusion prevention systems (IPS) can go a step further by automatically blocking or mitigating detected threats.

+ NGFW - Next Generation Firewall
  + NGFWs are sophisticated versions of traditional firewalls, equipped with advanced features like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention systems, some anti virus hash matching, and the ability to incorporate external threat intelligence. 

+ WAF - Web Application Firewalls
  + Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) protect web applications by monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. They help detect and prevent web-based attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other threats such as those listed in the OWASP Top 10. 

+ Cloud Detection and Response Tools
  + Cloud detection and response (CDR) tools extend threat detection and response capabilities to cloud environments. They monitor and analyze access and other activities across various cloud services and infrastructure to detect potential security threats. They help in detecting misconfigurations, unauthorized access, and other threats specific to the cloud environment, and can often be part of the authentication and authorization for cloud services.  

+ TIPs - Threat Intelligence Platforms
  + They are a key technology in threat detection and response. They collect, aggregate, and analyze data from a variety of sources to provide actionable intelligence about current and potential threats. TIPs can help organizations to understand the threat landscape, identify trends, and prioritize their security efforts.
        
+ IoC - Indicator of Compromise
  + Indicator of compromise (IoC) in computer forensics is an artifact observed on a network or in an operating system that, with high confidence, indicates a computer intrusion. IOC-based detection methods are classified as static.
  + Typical IoCs are virus signatures and IP addresses, MD5 hashes of malware files, or URLs or domain names of botnet command and control servers.
  + After IoCs have been identified via a process of incident response and computer forensics, they can be used for early detection of future attack attempts using intrusion detection systems and antivirus software.
    
+ IoA - Indicator of Attacks
  + Indicators of Attack (IOAs) demonstrate the intentions behind a cyberattack and the techniques used by the threat actor to accomplish their objectives.
  + An IOA is any digital or physical evidence that a cyberattack is likely to occur or is occuring.
  + The following examples of IOAs are based on common cybercriminal behavior:
    + Public servers communicating with internal hosts. This could be indicative of data exfiltration and remote communications from criminal servers.
    + Connections via non-standard ports rather than port 80 or port 443.
    + Excessive SMTP traffic. Could be evidence of a compromised system being used to launch DDoS attacks or a data leakage.
    + Malware reinfection within a few minutes of removal. This could be indicative of an Advanced Persistent Threat.
    + Multiple user logins from different regions or one source towards numerous systems in a short period of time. This could be indicative of stolen user credentials and lateral movement.
    + Cleaning up logs after mutiple IT operations to leave no trace.
   
+ YARA rules
  + It is a pattern-matching framework used to identify and classify malware and other IT security threats / Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
  + It provides an effective means to search for patterns of interest (such as IoCs) within multiple files, analyze them, and make informed decisions based on the results, making it an essential component of both network protection and endpoint security.
  + YARA is built into many malware scanners, including, but not limited to, ClamAV, Avast, ESET, Kaspersky, and VirusTotal; it is also featured in other popular types of IT security products such as Extended Detection and Response (EDR), Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions including AlienVault, and general threat intelligence platforms.  

+ SIGMA rules
  + It is a powerful tool that can be used for detection and malware threat hunting.
  + SIGMA rules are a type of open rule language that can be used to describe malicious activity and allow defenders to share detections (alerts, use cases) in a common language.
  + Much like YARA, or Snort Rules, SIGMA is another tool for the open sharing of detection, except focused on SIEM instead of files or network traffic.

### IX. Cybercrime Legislation Worldwide

#### 1. Cybercrime Legislation
  + Source/Website: https://unctad.org/page/cybercrime-legislation-worldwide
  + Cybercrime is a growing concern to countries at all levels of developments and affects both, buyers and sellers. The evolving cybercrime landscape and resulting skills gaps are a significant challenge for law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, especially for cross-border enforcement.
  + The UNCTAD Global Cyberlaw Tracker is the first ever global mapping of cyberlaws. It tracks the state of e-commerce legislation in the field of e-transactions, consumer protection, data protection/privacy and cybercrime adoption in the 194 UNCTAD member states. It indicates whether or not a given country has adopted legislation, or has a draft law pending adoption. In some instances where information about a country's legislation adoption was not readily available, 'no data' is indicated.
    
  + State of cybercrime legislation (December 2021)
     + 80% countries with legislation
     + 5% countries with draft legislation
     + 13% countries with no legislation
     + 1% countries with no data
       
  + While 156 countries (80 per cent) have enacted cybercrime legislation, the pattern varies by region:
     + Europe has the highest adoption rate (91 per cent)
     + Africa has the lowest adoption rate (72 per cent).

#### 2. Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (ETS No. 185)
  + Usefull links: https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention and https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/-/the-global-state-of-cybercrime-legislation-as-at-january-2023-
      
  + The Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime or the Budapest Convention, is the first international treaty seeking to address Internet and computer crime (cybercrime) harmonizing national laws, improving investigative techniques, and increasing cooperation among nations.
  + It was drawn up by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, with the active participation of the Council of Europe's observer states Canada, Japan, the Philippines, South Africa and the United States.
    
  + The Convention aims principally at:
     + Harmonizing the domestic criminal substantive law elements of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cyber-crime
     + Providing for domestic criminal procedural law powers necessary for the investigation and prosecution of such offenses as well as other offenses committed by means of a computer system or evidence in relation to which is in electronic form
     + Setting up a fast and effective regime of international cooperation
       
  + The following offenses are defined by the Convention:
    + illegal access and illegal interception
    + data interference and system interference
    + misuse of devices
    + computer-related forgery
    + computer-related fraud
    + offenses related to child pornography
    + offenses related to copyright and neighboring rights
    
  + In 2024 there are currently 76 parties to the Budapest Convention and 20 countries have signed or been invited to accede.

#### 3. United Nations Convention against Cybercrime
  + Source/Website: https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/convention/home.html
    
  + The United Nations Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in December 2024 in New York. The Convention is the first comprehensive global treaty on this matter, which provides States with a range of measures to be undertaken to prevent and combat cybercrime. It also aims to strengthen international cooperation in sharing electronic evidence for serious crimes.
  + The Convention will be opened for signature in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, and remain open at UN Headquarters in New York, until 31 December 2026. Signature is typically a requirement for a State to proceed with ratification. The Convention will enter into force, and become legally binding, 90 days after 40 States have expressed their consent to be bound by the Convention through depositing their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. 
    
  + Chapters of the United Nations Convention against Cybercrime
    + General provisions
      + The Convention unites States parties in a common purpose: to prevent and combat cybercrime, strengthen international cooperation, and promote technical assistance and capacity-building, in particular for developing countries. The chapter on general provisions forms the foundation for a comprehensive response against cybercrime and sets out the ground rules applicable to the entire Convention. 
    + Criminalization
      + The Convention’s chapter on criminalization requires that States parties establish a comprehensive framework targeting crimes committed through ICT systems.
    + Jurisdiction
      + The chapter on jurisdiction establishes clear and flexible rules to prevent criminals from exploiting jurisdictional gaps to escape punishment, while delineating the legal spheres that States parties can regulate.
    + Procedural measures and law enforcement
      + The chapter on procedural measures and law enforcement empowers States parties to address these challenges, adjusting traditional means and methods of investigation to the ICT environment. These measures enable the effective collection of electronic evidence while protecting human rights and supporting both domestic criminal proceedings and international cooperation.
    + International cooperation
      + The chapter on international cooperation therefore establishes a global framework that enables its Parties to assist each other in investigations, prosecutions, asset recovery, and judicial proceedings across borders.
    + Preventive measures
      + The chapter on preventive measures is designed to contribute to reducing and managing the risks and threats of cybercrime. Successfully preventing cybercrime requires active participation from and coordination of all stakeholders – governments, private sector, academia, civil society organizations, and the public as a whole.
    + Technical assistance and information exchange
      + The chapter on technical assistance and information exchange therefore establishes extensive measures for technical assistance, capacity-building and information exchange between States parties, with particular attention to developing countries' needs.
    + Mechanism of implementation
      + The chapter on the Mechanism of implementation therefore establishes the Conference of the States Parties to the Convention. The Conference serves as the primary mechanism to oversee the Convention’s implementation and improve the capacity of and cooperation between States parties to achieve the Convention’s objectives.
    + Final provisions
      + The chapter on final provisions includes the rules and modalities on how States may become parties to and withdraw from the Convention, on the entry into force of the Convention, its effects, related settlement of disputes, and potential amendment procedure and supplementation by protocols.

### X. Cybercrime and Threat Actors

#### 1. World Cybercrime Index
  + Sources/Websites: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297312 and https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level
    
  + Following three years of intensive research, an international team of researchers have compiled the first ever ‘World Cybercrime Index’, which identifies the globe’s key cybercrime hotspots by ranking the most significant sources of cybercrime at a national level (date: 2024).
    
  + The researchers say the location of cybercrimes has been hard to track previously because offenders often mask their physical locations by hiding behind fake profiles and technical protections. To collect data, they surveyed 92 leading cybercrime experts from around the world who are involved in cybercrime intelligence gathering and investigations.
    
  + The five major categories of cybercrime assessed by the study were:
     + Technical products/services (e.g. malware coding, botnet access, access to compromised systems, tool production).
     + Attacks and extortion (e.g. denial-of-service attacks, ransomware).
     + Data/identity theft (e.g. hacking, phishing, account compromises, credit card comprises).
     + Scams (e.g. advance fee fraud, business email compromise, online auction fraud).
     + Cashing out/money laundering (e.g. credit card fraud, money mules, illicit virtual currency platforms).

#### 2. Fighting cybercrime around the world 

> European Cybercrime Centre (EC3 - Europol)
 + Website: https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3

 + The European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) was set up by Europol to strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime. It offers operational, strategic, analytical and forensic support to Member States’ investigations.
 
 + Since its establishment in 2013, EC3 has made a significant contribution to the fight against cybercrime and it has been involved in many high-profile operations and hundreds of operational-support deployments. 
 
> Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT)
 + The Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT) was launched in September 2014. Located at Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), it helps fighting cybercrime within and outside the EU.
 
  + J-CAT’s objective is to drive intelligence-led, coordinated action against key cybercrime threats and targets by facilitating the joint identification, prioritisation, preparation, initiation and execution of cross-border investigations and operations by its partners. It tackles:
     + cyber-dependent crimes;
     + transnational payment fraud;
     + online child sexual exploitation;
     + cross-crime cyber facilitators (e.g. bulletproof hosting, counter-antivirus services, criminal use of the dark web, etc.).

  + It consists of a standing operational team of cyber liaison officers from several EU Member States and non-EU cooperation partners, who are based in Europol headquarters and complemented with EC3 staff. The cyber liaison officers come from:
     + 13 EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Poland, Sweden, Denmark and Spain, which is represented by two agencies: Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil);
     + 7 non-EU partner countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia*, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which is represented by four agencies: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Homeland Security Investigations);
     + Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3).

  + Over the past decade, the J-CAT has been instrumental in numerous high-profile operations, such as:
     + Operation Cronos (2024)
       + The global law enforcement operation that took down LockBit, one of the world’s most harmful ransomware groups. 
       + The results of the operation were unprecedented: on top of seizing LockBit’s data leak site and affiliate panel, law enforcement agencies seized 34 servers operated by LockBit, closed 14,000 “rogue accounts” involved with data exfiltration or the group’s infrastructure” and froze 200 cryptocurrency accounts linked to LockBit and its affiliates.
     + Operation EndGame (2024)
       + Largest ever operation against botnets. This operation adopted an international and comprehensive approach to address the growing threat of botnets being used as initial access points for ransomware and other malware.
       + This international operation shut down droppers including IcedID, SystemBC, Pikabot, Smokeloader and Bumblebee leading to four arrests and takedown of over 100 servers worldwide
     + Operation PowerOFF (2022)
       + Some fifty of the world’s biggest booter services, designed to enable users to launch crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) against critical online infrastructure, have been taken down as part of an international crackdown against DDoS service providers.
       + Known as Operation Power Off, this operation saw law enforcement in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland and Germany take action against these types of attacks which can paralyse the internet.  
     + Operation Fifth Element (2021)
       + A total of 12 individuals wreaking havoc across the world with ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure were targeted as the result of a law enforcement and judicial operation involving eight countries. More than 50 foreign investigators, including six Europol specialists, were deployed to Ukraine for the action day to assist the National Police with conducting jointly investigative measures.
       + These attacks are believed to have affected over 1800 victims in 71 countries. These cyber actors were known for specifically targeting large corporations, effectively bringing their business to a standstill.

	    
#### 3. ENISA Threat Landscape 2024

  + Source (2024) - https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2024

  + Most active ransomware strains (reporting period = July 2023 - June 2024)
    + Ransomware attacks target a broad spectrum of industries, with the Industrial and Manufacturing sector being the most frequent, high-impact victim, followed closely by Retail and Digital Service Providers.
    + In the global landscape during the reporting period, LockBit, CL0P and PLAY were some of the top ransomware strains used in RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) and extortion attacks in terms of victim organisations. The information has been derived by merging data collected from the leak sites associated with various extortion groups and supplementing it with Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). 
      + TOP 3
        - LockBit - 936 potential victims
        - CL0P    - 391 potential victims
        - PLAY    - 346 potential victims
    + Note: On February 2024, authorities seized LockBit's infrastructure, recovered decryption keys for thousands of victims, and took control of its data leak site. 

  + Ransom demand VS. Ransom payment
    + An increasing number of organisations declare to pay ransom demands, signalling a growing resilience against these cyber-attacks. When payments are made, they often fall short of the initial amounts demanded, indicating that successful negotiation tactics were employed by victims. 
    + In early 2024, a Fortune 50 company paid a record-breaking $75 million ransom payment to the Dark Angels ransomware gang, according to a report by Zscaler ThreatLabz. This extraordinary incident underscores the immense financial risk posed by ransomware attacks and the potential for catastrophic consequences if organisations are unprepared.

  + Data breaches
    + Data threats in general and data breaches in particular are widening, targeting almost all organisations and populations.
    + Data breaches, particularly data exfiltration, are increasing in speed, with data exfiltrated in hours, not days. The median time in 45% of the cases for non-extortion attacks is less than a day.
    + According to IBM in its 'Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023':
      + the mean time to identify and contain breaches is stable at 277 days.
      + the average total cost of a data breach increased by 2.3% from USD 4.35 million in 2022 to USD 4.45 million in 2023.

  + Malware information stealers persist and evolve
    + Information stealers, a type of malware that pilfers sensitive data, continue to be a significant concern.
    + According to information from multiple sources and from data collected by ENISA itself, the most common information stealers throughout 2023 and 2024 were:
      + RedLine: a malware that steals saved credentials, autofill data and banking information appeared in 2020, and saw a wide distribution in different cyber-attacks. Most of the time, however, it was aimed against single users, as its functionality fits best for this purpose.
      + Raccoon Stealer: a password stealer and crypto stealer that targets autofill logs, cryptocurrency wallets. In its scope are browser autofill files, cookies and online banking credentials, on top of the ability to pluck cryptocurrency wallets.
      + Vidar: A trojan malware that can steal sensitive information via a computer. It offers a modular approach towards data stealing. It also performs self-destruction after successful data exfiltration.
      + ...

  + DDoS attacks
    + Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) targets system and data availability and, though it is not a new threat (it celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2024), it plays a significant role in the cybersecurity threat landscape.
    + DDoS reached an average of 1,700 attacks per day according to Microsoft, and 13 million attacks worldwide. 
    + According to Gcore, attacks of unprecedented power were observed in 2023, with a 100% plus increase in the peaks of attack volume in the last three years, from 300Gbps in 2021 to 1.6Tbps in 2023. The attack duration varied from three minutes to nine hours with an average of about one hour. 
      

 #### 4. MITRE - List of Threat/Activity Groups

  + Groups are activity clusters that are tracked by a common name in the security community. Analysts track these clusters using various analytic methodologies and terms such as threat groups, activity groups, and threat actors. Some groups have multiple names associated with similar activities due to various organizations tracking similar activities by different names. Organizations' group definitions may partially overlap with groups designated by other organizations and may disagree on specific activity.

  + Groups are mapped to publicly reported technique use and original references are included. The information provided does not represent all possible technique use by Groups, but rather a subset that is available solely through open source reporting. Groups are also mapped to reported Software used and attributed Campaigns, and related techniques for each are tracked separately on their respective pages.
