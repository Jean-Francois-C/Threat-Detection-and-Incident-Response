Examples of Threat Detection with Elastic Security for Endpoint (EDR)
=====================================================================================================================

For testing and research purposes, I created, uploaded and ran several malware (obfuscated/encrypted C2 implants & shellcode loaders, packed version of mimikatz)
on a Windows server 2022 hosted in my Red Team Lab protected by an AV solution and Elastic Security for Endpoint (EDR).
The malware use various defense evasion techniques such as: AMSI patching, ETW patching, NTDLL unhooking, sandbox evasion, obfuscation and encryption, etc.

===========================
Threat detection results
===========================

The Elastic Security solution (EDR) is pretty efficient and was able to detect almost all my malware and raise multiple critical alerts such as:
> Malware Detection Alert
> Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: AMSI or WLDP Bypass via Memory Patching
> Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: Parallel NTDLL Loaded from Unbacked Memory
> Malicious Behavior Detection Alert: Network Module Loaded from Suspicious Unbacked Memory
> Memory Threat Detection Alert: Windows.Hacktool.Mimikatz
> Memory Threat Detection Alert: Windows.Trojan.Havoc
> Memory Threat Detection Alert: Windows.Trojan.Donutloader
> Memory Threat Detection Alert: Shellcode Injection

Elastic Security for Endpoint detects malware and advanced threats based on:
> malicious signatures / heuristic checks
> malicious behaviour checks
> live memory scans

To display security alerts raised by Elastic Security
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Log into the Elastic Web interface
2. Go to the section "Security > Alerts" to display the security alerts.
